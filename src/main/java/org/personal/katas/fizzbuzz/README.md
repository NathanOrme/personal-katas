## Complexity

Low

## What's the task?

Write a function that takes positive integers and outputs their string representation.

Your function should comply with the following additional rules:

If the number is a multiple of three, return the string "Fizz".
If the number is a multiple of five, return the string "Buzz".
If the number is a multiple of both three and five, return the string "FizzBuzz".

### Minimum requirements

- Write a function that will correctly output either: the number, Fizz, Buzz or FizzBuzz
- Ensure that tests are written to cover the code coverage
- To be written in TDD (Test Driven Development)

### Optional Extras

- Change the code so that it loops through all numbers up to the input to output the number, fizz, buzz or fizzbuzz
  ```
  Example output:
  For the number 15: 1, 2, Fizz, 4, Buzz, Fizz, 7, 8, Buzz, Buzz, 11, Fizz, 13, 14, FizzBuzz
  ```

## Things to consider

- Use Git and commit code as & when - don't do a "big bang" push for your code
- Don't over-engineer the code
