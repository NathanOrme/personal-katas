## Complexity

Low

### Example Divisors

6 has the divisors of (1, 2, 3)

## What's the task?

### Minimum requirements

- Write a function that takes a numerical value as an input, and prints out all of its divisors
- Ensure that tests are written to cover the code coverage
- To be written in TDD (Test Driven Development)

### Optional Extras

- Change the code so that it loops through all numbers up to the input to output a map, where the key is the number and
  the values are all of its divisors
  ```
  Example output for number 4:
  [{2, [1]}, {3, [1]}, {4, [1, 2]}]
  ```

## Things to consider

- Use Git and commit code as & when - don't do a "big bang" push for your code
- Don't over-engineer the code
