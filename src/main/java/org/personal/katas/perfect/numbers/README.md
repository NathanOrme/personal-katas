## What's a Perfect Number?

A perfect number in Mathematics is when a number's divisors add up the number itself.

### Example Perfect Numbers
6 is a perfect number as its divisors (1, 2 and 3) add up to 6.

28 is another perfect number  (1, 2, 4, 7, 14)

## What's the task?

### Minimum requirements

- Write a function that takes a numerical value as an input, and prints out whether its a perfect number or not.
- Ensure that tests are written to cover the code coverage
- To be written in TDD (Test Driven Development)

### Optional Extras

- Change the code so that it loops through all numbers up to the input to output which numbers are perfect numbers and
  which aren't
  ```
  Example output:
  For the number 28, the following perfect numbers were found: 6, 28
  ```
- Change the output so that it shows a map of a perfect number, and it's associated divisors

## Things to consider:

- Use Git and commit code as & when - don't do a "big bang" push for your code
- Don't over-engineer the code
